# STAR-WARS-2074
Great project that I enjoyed when I was building it!

I built it with React.Js framework and I used API technologies, bootstrap, SASS, React router, useState(), React hooks and more technologies! In this project, users can search for specific planets and residents by entering a few letters and also can look up different information about those planets.
All of that information comes from a different website called " https://swapi.dev/ " and I populate them on the website by using API technologies.
